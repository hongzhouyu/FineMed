       " 'text': 'COOLIEF radiofrequency is a new non-invasive, outpatient treatment option for those suffering from knee pain, hip pain, SI joint, and chronic back pain. This advanced procedure uses radiofrequency energy to safely target the sensory nerves causing pain. COOLIEF circulates water through the device that serves as a heat sink while heating nerves to create a treatment area that is larger than conventional radiofrequency ablation. This combination targets the pain-causing nerves without excessive heating or damage to surrounding tissues. I have performed this procedure with great success for many patients. It is safe for patients who have undergone joint replacement because this procedure blocks nerve pain before the nerves enter the joint space.\\nMedical marijuana has been in the news a lot lately. Since it became legal under Florida state law for certain medical conditions, many people have asked me about whether it is right for them or their loved ones, whether it is legal, what forms of the drug may be used, and how to find a treatment center.\\nTo address these and other questions, I will be giving a talk tonight February 28, 2018 at 6:00pm at the West St. Petersburg Community Library at 6605 5th Ave. N St. Petersburg, FL 33710.\\nSorry for the short notice – I will try to advertise these community talks further in advance. If you cannot make it to the talk, you may find some of your answers at the Office of Medical Marijuana Use. Or feel free to call my office at (727) 495-6085.\\nIn June, Dr. Bunch appeared on Bay News 9 to discuss Coolief, a technique for treating knee, hip, low back and other joint pains. The procedure is an outpatient, non-invasive treatment that has FDA approval for osteoarthritis.',\n",
